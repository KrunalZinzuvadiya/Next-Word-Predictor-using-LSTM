# LSTM Mini Project - Text Generation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text generation. The model is trained on a dataset of text sequences and learns to predict the next character or word based on previous inputs.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Cleaning and tokenizing text data.  
  - Converting text sequences into numerical representations.  
  - Creating input-output pairs for training.  

- **LSTM Model Architecture:**  
  - Embedding layer for word/character representations.  
  - One or more LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies.  
  - Dense layer with Softmax activation for predicting the next character/word.  

- **Training & Evaluation:**  
  - Model trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.  
  - Evaluated based on loss and accuracy metrics.  

- **Text Generation:**  
  - Generates new text sequences based on a seed input.  
  - Can be adjusted for temperature-based sampling to control creativity.  

## Dataset
The dataset consists of a collection of text data, which can be:
- A book or literary work (e.g., Shakespeare, poetry).  
- Song lyrics or articles.  
- Any custom text corpus for training.  

## Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
